        "None is better than some. As you prepare for this holiday week, go in with a plan. In-the-moment will power will fail. One bite only will fail. Earn self respect + start the New Year w forward momentum versus a deficit. As a starter: avoid sugar, alcohol and overeating.",
        "Don't worry, be happy. A Swedish study published last week found that among 4129 individuals with health anxiety disorder (aka. Hypochondriasis), the all-cause mortality risk was 69% higher than the control cohort of 41290 participants, over 23 years of follow up. Both natural and unnatural causes of death contributed to this increase, 60% and 143% increase in mortality risk due to natural and unnatural causes, respectively. Tragically ironic, suicide was the lead unnatural mortality cause in the health-anxeity population, with 314% increase. This is a great reminder that health has two equally important components, physical and psychological. Blueprint is my answer to this problem of health anxiety, as it automates data-driven decision making and implementation, relieving my brain from the unfair burden of making health decisions in a complex world of rapidly growing knowledge and stark misalignment to our attention spans, psychology, and evolutionary drives. I'm trying to do the same for you too."
